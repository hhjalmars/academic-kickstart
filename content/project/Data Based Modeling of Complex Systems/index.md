The trend towards more and more complex, reliable
and secure high performance distributed systems poses great
technical challenges. This is due to increasing demands on
performance, efficiency, safety and environmental aspects. 
The research area of cyber-physical systems, i.e~integrations of
computation and physical processes, has recently received a lot of
attention. The objective is to integrate the dynamics of the
physical system with the state of the art in information and
communication technology solutions.   Advances in (wireless)
communications systems and micro-electronics are being
key enablers for this rapid development; allowing systems to
be efficiently inter-connected in networks, reducing costs and
size and paving the way for new sensors and actuators.  Model based methods for
optimization and control of such systems are crucial to cope with
the problem of complexity.  Examples abound in areas as diverse as
process industry, vehicular systems and mobile communication
systems. In particular networked systems pervade many of today's
technologies such as the Internet, power distribution grids and
process manufacturing. While this important area is currently
receiving ample attention in many research communities, not so
much attention has been devoted from a modeling and, especially,
a system identification perspective. 

Since the key paradigm for systems design, analysis and control is
model based, this is a shortcoming that risk to impair the
developments in the field. Our research agenda aims at developing
system identification methods and theory to overcome these
difficulties. It covers the following topics:

1. *Fundamental limitations.* At the heart of
    system identification lies the question of what
    information measured data conveys regarding the system. In
    particular it is of interest to understand the underlying
    limitations of various configurations of the system
    identification problem in terms of the resulting model
    accuracy. We aim to target identification of nonlinear
    systems for which not much is   known regarding this
    issue, using a geometric analysis method we recently have
    developed. This is a key part of the project that also
    underpins the   other sub-projects described below.

2. *Cost of complexity.* Factors such as the
    performance specifications of the application, the system
    dynamics, the noise and disturbance characteristics and
    the used model structure determine what the experimental
    cost will be for performing an identification experiment
    that allows a model to be identified that is sufficiently
    accurate for the intended application. The quantification
    of this dependence we call the
 "cost of complexity". Knowing this quantity allows the user to make
 informed trade-offs, e.g. between performance specs. and the experimental
 cost. In particular we will consider the cost of complexity
for Model  Predictive Control (MPC), the dominating advanced
control algorithm, and deconvolution filtering, an essential
component in communications systems. Both these applications
are MIMO.

3. *Adaptive learning and control using restricted complexity models.* Using our geometric technique (see
item 1), we have shown that certain system properties can be
identified consistently even in the case of severe
under-modeling provided that the input excitation is chosen
carefully. While this input is in itself dependent on the true
system, we have preliminary results that show that adaptive
algorithms based on optimal experiment design are very robust
(to under-modeling) and lead to consistent estimates.  We
intend to investigate to what extent this result can be
extended to general system properties. In terms of dual
control, these are algorithms tuned entirely towards learning
and in direct contrast with certainty equivalence adaptive
control. Thus it would be interesting to use our insights from
this problem to examine to what extent emphasizing the
identification objective would help robustify adaptive
control.

4. *Experiment design for nonlinear systems.* The
    behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems is very dependent
    on the choice of input signals and the corresponding
    operating regions. We intend to develop computationally
    tractable formulations of optimal experiment design
    problems for nonlinear systems. Further, using our
    geometric technique (see item I) we have shown that for
    linear systems there are system properties that can be
    identified at a cost that is independent of the system
    complexity, if an optimal input is used. We intend to
    extend this type of result to nonlinear systems as well as
    the robustness property discussed under Item 3 above.

5. *Structured systems.* For structured systems
    there is a range of open and interesting research
    problems. Models of physical systems are often based on
    combining and connecting simple blocks/behaviors,
    resulting in interconnected block structured systems. It
    is here of interest to investigate how much is lost in
    modeling accuracy if this structure is ignored. In a past
    VR project, we have done an investigation together with
    engineers from ABB about the use of system identification
    in process industry, where the objective of the model is
    model predictive control design [BW-B8]. The results highlighted
    many open research problems. Examples are 1) Automatic
    tools for preprocessing of data before system
    identification, 2) Input designs, which take process
    operating strategies, conditions and constraints into
    account, and in particular for subspace methods, 3)
    Structural system identification, e.g. subspace
    identification and model reduction methods. Input design
    for identification of structured systems is  also a rather
    open area of research.


6. *Decentralized and networked systems.* For
    identification of decentralized and networked systems we
    will build on the first five objectives. We will thus
    analyze the cost of complexity for this type of systems,
    we will investigate fundamental limitations, study
    experiment design and adaptive learning. In particular, we
    aim to study: i) The differences in model accuracy using
    decentralized and centralized identification. ii) How to
    improve decentralized estimates by allowing nodes to
  transmit information between themselves. Here it is of interest to
  transmit as little information as possible.
iii) How to device identification algorithms of low complexity
  in order to allow nodes of low complexity.
