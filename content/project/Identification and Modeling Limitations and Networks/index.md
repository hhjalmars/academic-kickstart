Networked systems pervade many of todays technologies
such as the Internet, power distribution grids and process
manufacturing. While this important area is currently receiving ample
attention in many research communities, not so much attention has
been devoted from modeling and, especially, identification
perspectives. Since models that capture the essential characteristics
of a system generally form the backbone for analysis and synthesis,
this is a shortcoming that risk to impair the developments in the field. 

The main objective with this proposal is twofold:

1. To continue our effort to develop an accurate model for
  window/acknowledgment based congestion control and to analyze its
  implications on the possibilities and limitations of this control paradigm.  

2. To analyze fundamental limitations of system identification,
  with emphasis on locally identified networked system models.
