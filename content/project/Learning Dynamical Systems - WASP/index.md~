In SmartFD project we aim at using mathematical modelling to improve the development of
protein drug (biopharmaceuticals) manufacturing cultivation process for optimal solutions at
reduced costs and labour. The focus of SmartFD will in particular be the creation of intelligent
model-based tools to develop the culture media and the feed strategies to be used in manufacturing
processes of fed-batch and perfusion. The market of feeds and media was nearly $3.2 billions
world-wide in 2014. Performing culture media and feeds are keys for the success of mammalian
cell-based cultivation process to obtain high yield and, as importantly, the desired quality of the
produced biopharmaceutical. Such tools will bring a significant advantage both for the medium/feed
manufacturer and for the industry developing new culture processes involved in the project.
Furthermore, the project will respond to two presently unmet needs: the absence of methods to
develop feeds/media supporting perfusion culture, and the possibility to use
mathematical modelling to simulate, predict, optimize and control a given quality attribute in
continuous culture system. By nature, such continuous process enables tuning a given
quality attribute in a dynamic and reversible way, appealing for design based on mathematical
modelling. Finally, an important aspect is that the rational approach SmartFD is taking, based on
process modelling, will generate a process more robust compared to today's method of trial-anderror
, strongly supporting a Quality-by-Design approach, asked for by the manufacturers and the
Health Authorities.

## Project team

The project is a collaborative effort between 3 groups at KTH.

: i) Dr. Veronique Chotteau
(bioprocessing and mathematical modeling), teamed for the experimental work with ii) Assoc.
 at KTH Biotechnology/Glycoscience Division (expert in MS), iii) Prof.
Elling Jacobsen/Prof. Håkan Hjalmarsson at KTH Automatic Control (experts in automatic control,
modelling and model identification), and iv) the manufacturer GE Healthcare (GE-HC) and v) the
end-user Cobra Biologics (Cobra).
