Technical devices integrating physical systems with sensing, actuation, computation and communication, offers fantastic
opportunities for society. Challenges in this context are robustness and adaptability.
Estimating models of dynamic systems from observed data is known as system identification. The area is highly
interdisciplinary, incorporating theory from many areas, and a wide spectrum of applications. The many facets of system
identification necessitate expert intervention. This bottleneck threatens the development outlined above.
With a team of internationally leading researchers from KTH and LiU, we target two of the core areas of the field from the
perspective that algorithms should produce reliable models without human intervention. The overarching aim is thus to
"unleash the algorithms". More specifically we target structured systems and address:

1. Convex algorithms for parameter
estimation, based on an idea of how to link iterative, prediction error and subspace methods together such that favorable
properties are inherited from all domains.

2. Analysis tools, allowing explicit insights into how sensors and excitation
properties influence estimation accuracy.
