Connected, intelligent transportation systems, active buildings, and smart power grids. Home-based health care, wireless manufacturing and positioning systems that work anywhere and everywhere. At the ACCESS Centre, we're finding ways to facilitate communication between people, systems and machines. A holistic approach helps us to achieve results with broad applicability. Through networked systems we're laying a foundation for a more sustainable society, less stressful life and a more responsible future.

## Project team

ACCESS - Autonomic Complex Communication nEtworks, Signals and Systems - has enabled KTH to bring together 160 researchers from Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics in order to carry out long-term interdisciplinary research and joint PhD education on complex networked communication systems. Prof. Hjalmarsson is one of the 17 original founding faculty of the center. 

## Project funding and duration

This is a Linnaeus Center funded by the [Swedish Research Council](https://www.vr.se/english.html) with duration 2007--2019.
