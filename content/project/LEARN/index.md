The objective with this project is to provide design tools and algorithms for model
management in robust, adaptive and autonomous engineering systems. The increasing demands on
reliable models for systems of ever greater complexity have pointed to several insufficiencies in today's
techniques for data-driven model construction. The proposal addresses key areas where new ideas are
required.
Modeling is a central issue in many scientific fields. System Identification is the term used in the
Automatic Control Community for the area of building mathematical models of dynamical systems
from observed input and output signals. Several other research communities work with the same
problem under different names, such as (data-driven) learning.
We have identified five specific themes where progress is both acutely needed and feasible:

1. Encounters with Convex Programming Techniques: How to capitalize on the remarkable recent
progress in convex and semidefinite programming to obtain efficient, robust and reliable
algorithmic solutions.

2. Fundamental Limitations: To develop and elucidate what are the limits of model accuracy,
regardless of the modeling method. This can be seen as a theory rooted in the Cramer-Rao
inequality in the spirit of invariance results and lower bounds characterizing, e.g., Information
Theory.

3. Experiment Design and Reinforcement Techniques: Study how well tailored and "cheap" experiments
can extract essential information about applications-relevant system properties. Also
study how such methods may relate to general reinforcement techniques.

4. Potentials of Non-parametric Models: How to incorporate and adjust techniques from adjacent
research communities, e.g. concerning manifold learning and Gaussian process regression in
machine learning.

5. Managing Structural Constraints: To develop structure preserving identification methods for
networked and decentralized systems.
