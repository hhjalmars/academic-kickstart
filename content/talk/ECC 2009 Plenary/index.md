summary: System identification of complex and structured systems
abstract: "A key issue in system identification is how to cope with high system
complexity. In this contribution we stress the importance of taking 
the application into account in order to cope with this issue.
We define the concept cost of complexity which is a measure of 
the minimum required experimental effort (e.g. used input energy) as a
function of the system complexity, the noise properties, and
the amount, and desired quality, of the system information to be
extracted from the data. This measure gives the user a handle on the
trade-offs that must be considered when performing identification with
a fixed experimental budget. Our analysis is based on the observation
that the identification objective is to guarantee that the estimated 
model ends up within a pre-specified ``level set'' of the application
objective. This geometric notion leads to a number of useful insights: 
Experiments should reveal system properties important for the
application but may also conceal irrelevant properties. The latter, 
dual, objective can be explored to simplify model structure
selection and model error assessment issues.  We also discuss
practical issues related to computation and implementation of optimal
experiment designs. Finally, we illustrate some fundamental
limitations that arise in 
identification of structured systems. This topic has bearings on
identification in networked and decentralized systems."
